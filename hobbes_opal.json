In order to provide this adaptability while also building in guidelines designed to preserve visual consistency, our team created a system that allows users to fully customize icons while also upholding rules to maintain rigorous design standards. Rather than animating each individual icon, this system of templatization reframes the processes through which we deliver animation.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/project/hobbes_opal.md","sha":"9f95a83d1e31aa68b9114f606c97abac9a9d9ab4"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-10-30T16:22:58.461Z"}
