  When Google asked Hobbes to animate the out-of-box experience for their Nest
  Hub Max, our team had an opportunity to leverage motion design for user
  education. Our challenge was to strategically employ animation within
  difficult design constraints, enabling users to understand their new hardware
  while setting a positive and productive tone for the user experience.

          Our team’s first task was to ensure that users understood how the
          camera works—how having it active improves their experience, but that
          by enabling privacy mode it can be physically disconnected. To convey
          these concepts clearly and efficiently, Hobbes designed a series of
          animated illustrations to visualize the physical hardware on the Nest
          Hub Max during the set-up experience.

          Relative to illustrating physical hardware, such as a camera,
          designing animations to depict more abstract principles such as a mesh
          network—the type of local network that allows all of a user’s home
          devices to communicate with one another—posed a bigger challenge. Our
          team needed to visualize the concept of an invisible, decentralized
          network in a way that the user would understand. Their animations also
          needed to keep users engaged and occupied while the Nest Hub Max
          completed important setup operations and connected to the user’s home
          network in the background.

          Every design our team created had to be delivered as a code-based
          animation. This forced us to design around some difficult constraints.
          To keep our animations from bloating the file size of an already large
          app, we designed and delivered them as lightweight JSON files. In
          doing so our team employed Lottie-based cel animation.

          Our team’s goal was clarity for the user. Yet if we depicted the Nest
          Hub Max interfaces with 100% accuracy, the designs would require
          constant updating to accommodate every future UI change and
          localization for every new market. So we future-proofed each design,
          making it abstract enough to avoid constant updating but literal
          enough for users to clearly understand the message.
