          When Google asked us to help teach users about the camera on their
          Nest Hub Max, we entered a conversation surrounding one of today’s
          most pressing issues: privacy. We understood why cautious customers
          might hesitate to install a camera in their living room, but also
          recognized an opportunity to educate users about their options,
          empowering them to take control of their privacy.

          We wanted to make sure they truly understood how the camera works—that
          having it active improves the user experience, but that by enabling
          privacy mode it can be physically disconnected. To convey these
          concepts clearly and efficiently, we created a series of animated
          illustrations for the Nest Hub Max set-up experience. These forced us
          to design around some difficult constraints..

          We needed to keep our animations from bloating the file size of an
          already large app, so we designed and delivered them as lightweight
          JSON files. In doing so we designed the first (that we know of)
          Lottie-based cel animation.

          And while our goal was clarity for the user, we knew that if we
          depicted the Nest Hub Max interfaces with 100% accuracy, our designs
          would require constant updating to accommodate every future UI change
          and localization for every new market. So we future-proofed each
          design, making it abstract enough to avoid constant updating but
          literal enough for users to clearly understand the message.

          Each of the problems we solved to create the Nest Hub Max setup
          experience emerged from the need to create clarity for the user—both
          now and in the future—and to prioritize addressing the broad feeling
          of caution that surrounds privacy issues today.
