          In 2019, many feel cautious about a camera in their living room. When
          Google asked us to help teach users about the camera on their Nest Hub
          Max, we knew we needed to be clear about what the camera does and how
          itâ€™s designed with privacy in mind. 


          We created a series of animated illustrations for the Nest Hub Max
          set-up experience with that goal in mind, but had to design around
          some difficult constraints -- chiefly, file size and future-proofing.

          In order to put users at ease, we wanted to make sure they truly
          understood the way the camera works-- that having it active improves
          your experience, but that privacy-mode physically disconnects it. The
          best way to clearly and quickly convey these concepts was through
          animation, which also adds significant file size to an already large
          app. To avoid this, we designed and delivered all of our animations as
          lightweight JSON files. This includes designing the first (that we
          know of) Lottie-based cel animation.

          We had a solve for the file size constraint, but still needed to
          address the issue of products and User Interfaces. Our goal was
          clarity for the user, but if we depicted the interfaces with 100%
          accuracy, our designs would have to be constantly updated with every
          future UI change and localized with every new market. So with each
          design, we sought out a balance between abstraction and literal
          representation -- abstract enough to avoid constant updating, but
          literal enough to users could understand the message.

          The Nest Hub Max Set Up Experience challenged us to prioritize the
          clarity for the user. This was essential given the broad feeling of
          caution around privacy issues today. It also gave us the opportunity
          to solve some difficult problems in order to avoid compromising clear
          communication.
