  Hobbes created our animated icon set, OP/AL, because we wanted to build a tool
  for the design community that had the flexibility to fit thousands of
  different use cases. In order to provide this adaptability while also building
  in guidelines designed to preserve visual consistency, our team created a
  system that allows users to fully customize icons while also upholding rules
  to maintain rigorous design standards. Rather than animating each individual
  icon, this system of templatization reframes the processes through which we
  deliver animation.

          Templatization demanded a filetype that was extremely lightweight—one
          that could accommodate the staggering number of deliverables required
          to allow variation of duration, color, scale, and stroke weight,
          without an unwieldy file size. Our team’s solution was a system built
          around JSON files that are infinitely adjustable yet also uphold a set
          of rules to ensure that the icons remain functional and striking.

          What began with a search for the best tool became our team’s creation
          of OP/AL, a system for animating icons that leverages Hobbes’
          knowledge of applied motion and design in a practical yet ambitious
          resource for designers and developers.
