          We built OP/AL because we needed a tool that we couldn’t find anywhere
          else: an eye-catching and customizable animated icon set that could
          function as a serious resource for designers and developers. We wanted
          a tool that wouldn’t scream “free tool” when deployed. We needed the
          flexibility to fit thousands of different use cases. And we challenged
          ourselves to make it foolproof—ensuring every possible customization
          still upheld rigorous design standards.

          To meet these constraints our solution demanded a filetype that was
          extremely lightweight—one that could accommodate the staggering number
          of deliverables required to allow variation of duration, color, scale,
          and stroke weight, without an unwieldy file size. Our solution was a
          system built around JSON files that are infinitely adjustable yet also
          uphold a set of rules to ensure that our icons remain functional and
          striking.

          What began with a hunt for the best tool ended with OP/AL, a passion
          project that symbolizes—both figuratively and literally—our constant
          drive to produce better work.
