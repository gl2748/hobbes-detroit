  Hobbes created our animated icon set, OP/AL, because we wanted to build a tool
  for the design community that had the flexibility to fit thousands of
  different use cases. In order to provide this adaptability while also building
  in guidelines designed to preserve visual consistency, our team created a
  system that allows users to fully customize icons while also upholding rules
  to maintain rigorous design standards. Rather than animating each individual
  icon, this system of templatization reframes the processes through which we
  deliver animation.

          OP/AL is a free-to-use resource that helps users easily customize and
          download a set of 100 animated icons as code, ready to be implemented.

          This project emerged from a fascination with json files and the
          possibilities of live animation, driven by code. By tinkering with
          json files, we found relationships that established how certain
          variables affected the animations. One of the most important
          discoveries was that **OP (outPoint) / AL (animationLength) = FR
          (frameRate)**. This equation allowed us to dictate the duration of
          animations after they had been exported, and from that, OP/AL was
          born.


          We created the animated icon set OP/AL to provide the design community
          with a resource that has the flexibility to fit thousands of different
          use cases.By using Lottie and json files, we were able to create
          something powerful enough to accomplish all of this, but light enough
          to make an entire animated set around the size of a megabyte.

          The goal of our approach was to provide as much creative autonomy as
          we could to the user, while still ensuring the generated icons
          communicated effectively. The most important constraints for
          guaranteeing readability were the use of two-pixel stroke and
          counterstrokes, and adhering the icons to a 24x24 pixel grid. Because
          the design of each icon was determined from its smallest and thickest
          possible iterations, theyâ€™ll always remain legible despite changes in
          scale or stroke weight.

          While the design constraints helped in creating the set initially,
          animation is where we were most excited to explore the code and create
          parameters. This allowed us to set limits and relationships for
          certain variables, providing an additional level of quality control to
          the assets the tool creates.

          Though this project was originally conceived as a vehicle for
          exploration in json, it evolved into a more specific and directed
          effort. Its final form allowed us to contribute to a larger goal of
          visioning design and animation for scale through simple and accessible
          tools.
