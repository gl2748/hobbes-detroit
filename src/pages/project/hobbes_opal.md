  Hobbes created our animated icon set, OP/AL, because we wanted to build a tool
  for the design community that had the flexibility to fit thousands of
  different use cases. In order to provide this adaptability while also building
  in guidelines designed to preserve visual consistency, our team created a
  system that allows users to fully customize icons while also upholding rules
  to maintain rigorous design standards. Rather than animating each individual
  icon, this system of templatization reframes the processes through which we
  deliver animation.

          Hobbes created our animated icon set, OP/AL, because we wanted to
          build a tool for the design community that had the flexibility to fit
          thousands of different use cases. In order to provide this
          adaptability while also building in guidelines designed to preserve
          visual consistency, our team created a system that allows users to
          adjust the properties of the entire icon set and to download the
          collection once it has been suited to their needs. Rather than
          animating each individual icon, this system of templatization reframes
          the processes through which we deliver animation.

          A functional animated icon set demanded a filetype that was extremely
          lightweight. Customization also required a filetype which could be
          adjusted live on the site, avoiding the need to animate every possible
          permutation of each icon. Our team’s solution was a system built
          around JSON files, which are remarkably small and allow for live
          variation of duration, color, scale, and stroke weight.

          What began with a search for the best tool became our team’s creation
          of OP/AL, a system for animating icons that leverages Hobbes’
          knowledge of applied motion and design in a practical yet ambitious
          resource for designers and developers.
