          Hobbes loves clocks. In fact, weâ€™d already spent months pondering how
          we might leverage design and animation to reimagine displaying the
          time when Google SUMUX happened to ask us to create clock faces for
          their Smart Displays. And when they did, we went a little crazy.

          We recognized that Google Smart Displays live on end tables in living
          rooms and on counters in kitchens, and that our clock faces would need
          to suit this real world context. So we set out to make artwork that
          tells the time, creating designs that transform information displays
          into pieces of home decor while remaining purposeful at every second.

          In order to remain true to the fundamental elements of clock design,
          our clock faces also needed to incorporate movement. Our challenge was
          to balance the rapid, eye-catching motion you might find in an
          animated gif against slow, meaningful motion systems that could span
          the course of an entire day.

          The result of this collaboration is a set of delightfully clever
          designs that, at first glance, might look like artwork in the drawing
          room. On closer examination they change throughout the day, telling
          the time and punctuating each minute with a moment of small delight.
