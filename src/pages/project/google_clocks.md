  Even before Google SUMUX asked Hobbes to animate clock faces designed for
  their Smart Displays, our team had been exploring time displays as an
  opportunity to apply motion design in a non-traditional medium. Animating the
  designs that Google had created required our team to build systems that would
  both satisfy the discerning eye of an animation lover and function exactingly
  throughout each minute of an entire day.

          Even before Google SUMUX asked Hobbes to animate clock faces for their
          Smart Displays, our team had been exploring time displays as an
          opportunity to apply motion design to a non-traditional medium.
          Animating Google’s designs required our team to build systems that

          In addition to animating Google’s clock faces, our team created a
          broad array of supplementary designs, all of which are built around
          motion. Each design expresses a unique approach to a clock layout and
          animation style.  And because each clock incorporates many frequent
          animations, rather than being a single animation, our team’s broader
          challenge was to build motion design systems that would successfully
          control and methodize every animation that must occur across a 24-hour
          period.

          Hobbes also recognized that clock faces would need to suit the real
          world context for Google Smart Displays, which sit on end tables in
          living rooms and on counters in kitchens. The motion design systems
          that our team created for Google SUMUX were built with the goal of
          transforming information displays into decor that tells the time.

          The result of this collaboration is a set of designs that, at first
          glance, might simply look like artwork. On closer examination they
          change throughout the day, communicating the time while punctuating
          each minute with a moment of small delight.
