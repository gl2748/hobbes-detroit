          Motion is an important aspect of clock design, but not the rapid,
          attention grabbing motion of an animated gif. The movement has to take
          place over 24 hours and be meaningful at every second. We tried to
          find a balance between these two motion types in each of our designs,
          creating slow, meaningful motion systems punctuated by moments of
          small delight on the minute.
