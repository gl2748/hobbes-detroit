  Even before Google SUMUX asked Hobbes to animate clock faces designed for
  their Smart Displays, our team had been exploring time displays as an
  opportunity to apply motion design in a non-traditional medium. Animating the
  designs that Google had created required our team to build systems that would
  both satisfy the discerning eye of an animation lover and function exactingly
  throughout each minute of an entire day.

          In addition to animating Google’s clock faces, our team tasked itself
          to create a broad array of supplementary designs, all of which are
          built around motion. Within each the animations of each clock face,
          each specific design dictates every frame. Yet because each animation
          creates movement as often as every second, our team’s broader
          challenge was to build motion design systems that would successfully
          control and methodize every animation that occurs across a 24-hour
          period.

          Hobbes also recognized that our clock faces would need to suit the
          real world context for Google Smart Displays, which live on end tables
          in living rooms and on counters in kitchens. The motion design systems
          that our team created for Google SUMUX were built with the goal of
          transforming information displays into decor that tells the time.

          The result of this collaboration is a set of designs that, at first
          glance, might look like artwork in the drawing room. On closer
          examination they change throughout the day, communicating the time
          while punctuating each minute with a moment of small delight.
