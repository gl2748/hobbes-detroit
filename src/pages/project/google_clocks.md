          Motion is an important aspect of clock design, but not the rapid,
          attention grabbing motion of an animated gif. The movement has to take
          place over 24 hours and be meaningful at every second. We tried to
          find a balance between these two motion types in each of our designs,
          creating slow, meaningful motion systems punctuated by moments of
          small delight on the minute.

          We also spent time considering the real world context around these
          clocks. GoogleSmart Displays are placed on end tables in living rooms
          or on counters in kitchens. So we tasked ourselves to stretch our
          designs beyond information displays and into something that  could
          function as pieces of home decor.

          How might we create a piece of artwork that tells the time? Hobbes
          loves clocks. After months of discussing how we could do something new
          with a clock, Google SUMUX happened to asked us help create clock
          faces for their Smart Displays. We went a little crazy.
