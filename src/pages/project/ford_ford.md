          In order to remain true to the fundamental elements of clock design,
          our clock faces also needed to incorporate movement. Our challenge was
          to balance the rapid, eye-catching motion you might find in an
          animated gif against slow, meaningful motion systems that could span
          the course of an entire day.

          The result of this collaboration is a set of delightfully clever
          designs that, at first glance, might look like artwork in the drawing
          room. On closer examination they change throughout the day, telling
          the time and punctuating each minute with a moment of small delight.
