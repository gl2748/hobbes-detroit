  When our partner, Firefly Drone Shows, began experimenting with drone
  formations, the Hobbes team saw a unique opportunity to apply motion design in
  an experiential, real world setting. Our challenge was to design choreography
  that could function in 3-D space using the principles that underlie our
  digital animations. In doing so, our team built a system to satisfy a
  multitude of difficult technical and design challenges.

          To animate a fleet of individual drones, our team treated the drones
          as pixels, choreographing a show in 3-D design software and
          translating the data into a form readable by a drone fleet. Whereas
          pixels exist within the two-dimensional landscape of a screen, drones
          move through three dimensions and are bound by physical constraints.
          This required our team to account for variables such as top flight
          speed and maximum altitude, all while adhering to FAA rules. Our
          design system therefore needed to allow every drone’s path to be
          precisely choreographed from take off to landing in order to maintain
          compliance with regulations and to avoid collisions.

          After developing a framework for handling the technical challenges,
          our team focused on enhancing the viewer experience. To create the
          capability to design drone shows that would take an audience’s breath
          away, we developed a visual language, established best practices for
          pacing, determined how to effectively use forced perspective, and
          more.

          Through many iterations over more than a year, Hobbes’ work with
          Firefly evolved from a series of isolated formations into a single,
          cohesive experience that can capture the imagination of 10,000+
          viewers at once, as with this audience at the 2019 World Scout
          Jamboree.
