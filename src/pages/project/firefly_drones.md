  When our partner, Firefly Drone Shows, began experimenting with drone
  formations, the Hobbes team saw a unique opportunity to apply motion design in
  an experiential, real world setting. Our challenge was to design choreography
  that could function in 3-D space using the principles that underlie our
  digital animations. In doing so, our team built a system to satisfy a
  multitude of difficult technical and design challenges.

          To animate a fleet of individual drones, our team’s strategy was to
          treat the drones as pixels, creating a drone show using 3-D design
          software. In order to do so, we needed to devise a strategy for
          translating data from Cinema 4D into a form that would be readable by
          a drone fleet. Whereas pixels engage from within the two-dimensional
          landscape of a screen, drones move through three dimensions and are
          bound by physical constraints. This required our team to account for
          variables such as top flight speed and maximum altitude, all while
          acknowledging the governance of FAA rules. Our design systems
          therefore needed to allow every drone’s path to be precisely
          choreographed from take off to landing in order to maintain compliance
          with regulations and to avoid collisions.

          Our team’s final task became enhancing the viewer experience. To
          create the capability to design drone shows that would take an
          audience’s breath away, we developed a visual language, established
          best practices for pacing, and determined how to effectively use
          forced perspective.

          Through many iterations over more than a year, Hobbes’ work with
          Firefly evolved from a series of isolated formations into a single,
          cohesive experience that can capture the imagination of 10,000+
          viewers at once, as with this audience at the 2019 World Scout
          Jamboree.
