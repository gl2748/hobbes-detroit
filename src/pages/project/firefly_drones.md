          Today’s elaborate pyrotechnic displays showcase brilliant explosions
          planned expertly in patterns designed to dazzle. But what if every
          twinkling point of light in a fireworks show could be synchronized and
          controlled? 


          When our partner, Firefly Drone Shows, began experimenting with drone
          formations, we noticed that their choreography looked remarkably like
          some of our animations. The question arose: if we treated the drones
          as pixels, could we create a drone show with 3-D design software?

          To find out, our first challenge was to find a way to translate data
          from Cinema 4D into a form readable by a drone fleet. Whereas pixels
          engage from within the two-dimensional landscape of a screen, drones
          move through three dimensions and are bound by physical constraints:
          they have a top flight speed; they can’t exceed certain altitudes; and
          if they collide, they’ll crash. Because of these limitations and the
          governance of FAA rules, we needed every drone’s path to be precisely
          choreographed from take off to landing. So we next developed a system
          to maintain compliance with regulations and avoid collisions.
